# 📈🧪 Data Analytics Program 🧠📊 : Story of Rasmo Wanyama
Here is the story of my experience in the Data Analytics Program.

## Let me introduce Myself
👋 Hello! I'm Rasmo Wanyama, and I'm excited to share my professional history before diving into the world of data analytics! 🌟 With a Bachelor's degree in Real Estate, my journey started in the real estate industry, where I honed my skills in navigating property dynamics and contributing to the growth of diverse real estate projects. I accumulated 8 years of experience in Property Valuation, Facilities Management, Project Management, and Research across diverse African markets. My roles heavily involved utilizing property data for valuation, budgeting, financial reporting, and Real Estate market trends analysis. Seeking new challenges, I took a career break in July 2022, strategically pivoting into the data field where my domain knowledge in Real Estate would still be applicable. This led me to join Azubi Africa's Data Analytics program. 🚀

## How would I describe my experience in the data analytics program ? 
📊 My experience in the Data Analytics Program at Azubi Africa has been transformative and enriching. 🚀 The program provided me with a comprehensive set of technical skills, including proficiency in Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and various machine learning frameworks. 💡 I enjoyed the real-world projects during the career accelerator phase as they were a perfect application of the foundational skills during the bootcamp phase. 📈📊 Besides, as the team lead for two teams during the Career Accelerator phase, I enjoyed working and delivering projects using the Scrum methodology. The collaborative and dynamic learning environment not only expanded my technical proficiency but also enhanced my project management and communication skills. 🤝✨ With guidance from the instructors, I completed the program with a diverse skill set, enabling me to approach complex data challenges with creativity and precision. Overall, this experience has equipped me with the knowledge and confidence to make meaningful contributions to the field of data analytics. 🧠🔍🚀

## How would I say the Career Accelerator phase has introduced me to when it comes to data analytics? 
The Career Accelerator phase introduced me to practical, real-world applications of data analytics, enhancing my understanding of end-to-end project management in a data science context. It provided me with hands-on experience in handling large datasets, performing exploratory data analysis, building predictive models, and deploying machine learning solutions. This phase also emphasized the importance of leadership, teamwork, and collaboration, as I worked closely with peers to deliver high-quality projects using Agile methodologies.

## What enticed me to join the Data Analytics Program?
The opportunity to pivot into a rapidly growing field where my existing skills in real estate could be effectively utilized was a major enticement. Azubi Africa's emphasis on practical, hands-on learning, combined with personalized career support and real-world projects, convinced me that this program would provide the comprehensive training and career opportunities I was looking for.

## What would I say my progress in tech has been since joining the program? 
Since joining the program, my progress in tech has been remarkable. I have gained proficiency in key data analytics tools such as Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel. I have also developed strong skills in data visualization, machine learning, and statistical analysis. The program's practical projects and career coaching have significantly boosted my confidence and preparedness for a career in data analytics.

## What are my plans for the future ?
My plans for the future include continuing to develop my skills in data analytics and machine learning, with the goal of securing a senior data analyst or data scientist role. I also aim to leverage my background in real estate to provide data-driven insights and solutions within the property sector. Long-term, I hope to lead a team of data professionals and contribute to innovative projects that drive significant business value.

## What is my dream company or role ?
My dream role is to become a Senior Data Scientist at a forward-thinking tech company like Google or a leading real estate firm where I can apply my combined expertise in real estate and data analytics to solve complex problems and drive business growth. I am also open to opportunities in other industries where data-driven decision-making is critical.
